# Quiz-Time-Challenge-4

Still developing this project so it is reliable and not giving the wrong score 

Help from youtube videos of:

Coding with Nick

These videos led me in a way where I was able to see a full functional quiz but done in multiple ways. The way I decided to go was to create an interactive start-up page by putting a name placeholder and the rules of the game centered inbetween user name and start quiz 

Also, there needs to be improvement on how the correct answers are stored/counted properly and ensure that no matter the placement of the questions the right answer pairs with the right question.
